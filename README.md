The Cult of Done Manifesto
Introduction
Welcome to The Cult of Done Manifesto. This manifesto offers a set of guiding principles to help you stay motivated and productive in your creative endeavors. It encourages a mindset that prioritizes action and completion over perfection.

Manifesto
Three States of Being: There are three states of being: Not knowing, action, and completion.

Everything is a Draft: Accept that everything you create is a draft. Embrace imperfection; it's essential for progress.

No Editing Stage: Skip the overthinking and perfectionism. There's no separate editing stageâ€”just keep moving forward.

Embrace Uncertainty: Pretending to know what you're doing is almost as good as actually knowing what you're doing. So, accept that you know what you're doing, even if you don't, and get started.

Banish Procrastination: Don't let ideas linger. If you wait more than a week to act on an idea, it's time to let it go.

Focus on Completion: The goal is not just to finish but to create a springboard for more ideas and projects.

Dispose of Perfection: Perfection can be paralyzing. Don't aim for it; focus on getting things done.

Embrace Imperfection: Laugh at perfection. It's boring and keeps you from getting things done.

Get Your Hands Dirty: People who take action are the ones who are right. Dive in, even if it means getting your hands dirty.

Failure and Mistakes Are Progress: Failure and mistakes are not obstacles but stepping stones. They count as "done" in the journey of learning and creating.

Destruction as Creation: Sometimes, deconstruction and experimentation are forms of progress.

Share Your Ideas: When you have an idea and share it on the internet, consider it a "ghost of done." Sharing can lead to collaboration and further development.

Done Leads to More: Completion of one task or project fuels the motivation to tackle more.
